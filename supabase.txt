Absolutely! Here are the steps to set up Supabase on a different account and connect it to your project:

1. Create a Supabase Account
Go to https://supabase.com/ and sign up/log in with your desired host account.
2. Create a New Supabase Project
In the Supabase dashboard, click New Project.
Fill in:
Project Name
Organization (or create a new one)
Database password (remember/save it!)
Choose a region close to your users.
Click Create new project and wait for provisioning (may take a minute).
3. Get Your Project Credentials
Once the project is ready, go to Settings → API to find:
Project URL (e.g., https://xxxx.supabase.co)
Anon/public key (for client-side usage)
Service Key (for Admin/Edge Functions, keep private)
4. Set Up Database Schema
You need to migrate your current database tables (admissions, rides, drivers, expenses, etc.) to the new project:

Copy your existing migration SQL scripts from supabase/migrations/ in your repo.
Go to Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query.
Paste and run the migration scripts one by one, in the correct order.
5. Set Up Authentication (if needed)
Go to Auth → Settings; configure email logins, providers, and redirect URLs.
Make sure your app’s callback and site URLs are set (use your hosting or local URLs).
6. Update Environment Keys in Lovable
In Lovable, update your Supabase integration to use the new project’s URL and public anon key.
You would typically update:
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
If you are using functions or admin features, copy over the new Service Key securely.
7. Test Connection
Start your app.
Check if you can fetch data, sign up users, etc.
Watch the console or Supabase logs for errors (cross-check API URL and key if something fails).
Additional Tips
Data Migration: If you want to migrate old data, export via dashboard/psql from your old project and import into the new one.
Storage: You’ll need to recreate any Storage buckets in the new project.

Visit https://supabase.com/ and create a new account (or log in).
Click New Project.

Copy the Anon/public key
3. Configure Lovable Project to Use New Supabase Credentials
In Lovable, update the Supabase integration settings:
Enter the new Project URL as SUPABASE_URL.
Enter the new Anon/public key as SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
4. (Re-)Create Your Database Tables
Under Database → SQL Editor, run migration scripts for your schema (tables, constraints, policies).
Use your existing SQL migration files, or ask me if you need them regenerated!
5. Set Up Authentication Redirects (if needed)
Go to Authentication → URL Configuration in Supabase and set Site URL/Redirect URLs (must match your app’s deployed or development URLs).
6. Update Other Secrets (if used)
Update any other secret keys needed (SERVICE_ROLE, API keys, etc.) in Lovable’s integration, or via Supabase Functions Settings.
7. Test Your Connection
Start your app, log in, and try a few actions. Watch the console for errors.
Summary:

Make a new Supabase project
Copy its URL and anon key
Paste them into Lovable’s Supabase integration settings
Run your migrations in Supabase’s SQL editor
Set up URLs/secrets as required
Test the full workflow
